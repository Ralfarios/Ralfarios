# Sup 👋, I'm Ralfarios!

Currently, I'm working as a Software Engineer in <a href="https://pandatech.io/">Pandatech</a>, mainly focusing on Front-End web development with React ⚛️ and mobile apps with React Native ⚛️📱. In my free time, I'm usually exploring new technology or refactoring my old code to exercise my problem-solving skills. I do have other hobbies such as drawing and playing the guitar to unwind myself from programming things.

### Currently, I'm:
- 💻 Re-learning Flutter and NextJS for my next personal project
- 🌍 Learning other language to reach other country
